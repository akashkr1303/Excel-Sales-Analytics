# Customer Performance Report | P & L Report
## Project Objective:
To build multiple reports by performing data analysis on the historical data of AtliQ Hardware (an imaginary firm). 

## Business Model:
AtliQ Hardware is a firm that manufactures computer hardware, accessories, storage & networking devices and sells its products through various customers like Amazon, Flipkart, Walmart and its direct stores across regions using different modes of channels. 

## Project Description:
Extracted the data, and performed ETL (Extract transform load) in Power Query to make it suitable for data analysis needs. Built a star-schema data model using Power Pivot and used DAX to create needed measures. Optimized the report by up to 10% by disabling unrequired data load and ensured data quality by running data validation. The type of analysis can be further categorised into two types:- 


### 1) Sales Analysis- 

#### [a) Customer performance report](https://github.com/akashkr1303/Excel_Sales_Finance_Reports/blob/main/Customer%20Performance%20Report.pdf) - Analyzes sales across fiscal years and variance between 2020 and 2021 net sales.
#### [b) Market vs target performance](https://github.com/akashkr1303/Excel_Sales_Finance_Reports/blob/main/Market%20Performance%20vs%20Target.pdf) - It evaluates sales against target numbers based on different countries.
#### [c) Top & Bottom 5 products](https://github.com/akashkr1303/Excel_Sales_Finance_Reports/blob/main/Top%20%26%20Bottom%205%20Products.pdf) - It analyzes the top and bottom-most products of the company by quantity sold.
#### [d) Division level report](https://github.com/akashkr1303/Excel_Sales_Finance_Reports/blob/main/Division%20Level%20Report.pdf) - Analyzes sales across three divisions of the company.
#### [e) New products](https://github.com/akashkr1303/Excel_Sales_Finance_Reports/blob/main/New%20Products-2021.pdf) - Segregates new products that were launched in 2021 FY and their sales performance.



### 2) Financial Analysis-

#### [a) P&L Year](https://github.com/akashkr1303/Excel_Sales_Finance_Reports/blob/main/P%26L-Year.pdf) - It compares Net sales, COGS, Gross margin and Gross margin%  over the last three fiscal years.
#### [b) P&L Month](https://github.com/akashkr1303/Excel_Sales_Finance_Reports/blob/main/P%26L-Month.pdf) - It compares the same set of metrics as mentioned in P&L Year but on a monthly and quarterly level.
#### [c) P&L Markets](https://github.com/akashkr1303/Excel_Sales_Finance_Reports/blob/main/P%26L-Markets.pdf) -  It compares the same set of metrics as mentioned in P&L Year but on a country/market level.
